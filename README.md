# ⭐ Muun's Quest Checker

Muun’s Quest Checker allows you to run deepchecks and session checks for players using a custom Quest APK linked to your Discord bot.

## 📥 Installation Instructions (APK Setup)

Before a player can be deepchecked/checked, they must download and install the APK by running the command `/download` or downloading the apk directly from this github.
Once the bot sends the file, follow these steps:

```
Click the button under the bot’s message to download the latest APK from Discord.
Save the file to your computer.
Open SideQuest and connect your Meta Quest headset.
Drag and drop the APK into SideQuest, or click Install APK and select the downloaded file.
Wait for SideQuest to confirm the installation.
The app will now appear under Unknown Sources on your Quest and is ready to use.
```

## 🧪 Starting a Session

### After installing the APK:

Run the command: `/session`
Copy the generated session ID.
Open the Quest app, paste the session ID into the text box, and press Enter Session.

### ❗Important:

The Quest app must remain open and minimized.
Closing the app will end the session.
**All settings should be configured before starting a session.**
